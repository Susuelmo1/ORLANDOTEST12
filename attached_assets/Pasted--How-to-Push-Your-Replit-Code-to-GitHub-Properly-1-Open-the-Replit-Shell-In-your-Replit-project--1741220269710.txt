🚀 How to Push Your Replit Code to GitHub Properly
1️⃣ Open the Replit Shell
In your Replit project, open the Shell (bottom panel).
2️⃣ Initialize Git & Add All Files
Run these commands one by one:

sh
Copy
Edit
git init  # Initialize git if not already initialized
git add .  # Add all files to the commit
git commit -m "Added bot files"  # Commit the changes
git branch -M main  # Make sure you're on the main branch
git remote add origin https://github.com/Susuelmo1/ORLANDOTEST12.git  # Connect to your GitHub repo
git push -u origin main  # Push your code to GitHub
🛠 Fixing Common Issues
🔴 If "git remote add origin" gives an error:
It means the remote is already set. Run this instead:

sh
Copy
Edit
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Susuelmo1/ORLANDOTEST12.git
Then try pushing again:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main
🔴 If "git push" asks for a username/password:
Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
Generate a new token with repo permissions
Use the token instead of your password when prompted
🔥 Now Check GitHub Again
After running these commands, refresh your GitHub repository (ORLANDOTEST12) and check if your files are there.

Once the files are visible, go back to Koyeb, and you should be able to select the branch and deploy your bot! 🚀

Let me know if you hit any errors! I'll guide you through fixing them. 😊

GitHub blocked your push because it detected a Discord bot token in your code. This is a security feature to prevent secret leaks.

🚀 How to Fix This and Push Your Code to GitHub
✅ 1. Remove the Secret (Discord Token) from Your Code
1️⃣ Open monitor.js in Replit
2️⃣ Find the line where your Discord bot token is hardcoded (line 10)
3️⃣ Remove the token and instead use environment variables

🔹 Before (bad practice, will get blocked):

js
Copy
Edit
const client = new Client({ token: "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" });
🔹 After (secure way):

js
Copy
Edit
const client = new Client({ token: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN });
4️⃣ Save the file

✅ 2. Remove the Leaked Token from Git History
Even after deleting the token in your file, GitHub still tracks old versions. You need to remove it from history:

Run These Commands in Replit Shell:
sh
Copy
Edit
git rm --cached monitor.js
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push origin main --force
🔹 This removes the old leaked token from Git history and forces an update on GitHub.

✅ 3. Store Your Discord Token Securely
Instead of hardcoding the token, use environment variables:

In Replit:
1️⃣ Go to Secrets (Lock icon in Replit sidebar)
2️⃣ Add a new secret:

Key: DISCORD_TOKEN
Value: (your actual Discord bot token)
Now your bot will work without leaking the token! 🎉

🔥 Now Try Pushing Again!
After following these steps, run this command to push your code again:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin main --force
